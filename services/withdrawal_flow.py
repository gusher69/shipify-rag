"""CUSTOMER-RED-HOTFIX-2 -- Purchase Withdrawal / Shipping Withdrawal.

Cases CUS-S05 (Purchase Withdrawal) / CUS-S12 (Shipping Withdrawal,
Ai.xlsx sheet '2.tongchecknairabop' rows 5/12). Real LINE failure: both
questions were swallowed by an unrelated flow (a stale operational
"add_vat" ack, already fixed separately) or, once that stopped, fell to
ordinary RAG search — which for Purchase Withdrawal decisively matched
the WRONG chunk (an order-cancellation / Chinese-seller-refund FAQ that
happens to share "คืนเงิน" vocabulary), and for Shipping Withdrawal had
no matching content in the Knowledge Base at all, producing a bare "no
confirmed info" reply.

Both answers are plain, non-personalized HOW-TO instructions (no ERP
call, no per-customer data) — exactly the kind of content the Data
Routing Rule says belongs in the Knowledge Base, not hardcoded in
Python. This module does NOT hardcode the answer text: it reads it
straight out of `knowledge_chunks` by a STABLE `intent` tag
(PURCHASE_WITHDRAWAL / SHIPPING_WITHDRAWAL_SP / SHIPPING_WITHDRAWAL_FT
-- see tools/add_withdrawal_kb_content.py, the idempotent ingestion
script that seeds/updates those rows via the existing embedding
pipeline). Retrieval here is a direct, deterministic tag lookup, never
vector similarity -- the customer source is explicit that once the
intent (and, for shipping, the brand) is known, the answer must not be
left to "which chunk scores highest".

Shipping Withdrawal additionally branches by brand (SP vs FT) per the
customer source ("หัวข้อนี้จะต้องเช็คว่าเป็นแบรนด์ไหน SP หรือ FT").
The brand is resolved from the customer's own VERIFIED CustCode prefix
(the same "FT3182"-style code already used everywhere else in this
codebase as the account identity) when available -- never guessed --
so a trusted binding never has to be re-asked; otherwise the customer
is asked once, exactly as the source instructs.
